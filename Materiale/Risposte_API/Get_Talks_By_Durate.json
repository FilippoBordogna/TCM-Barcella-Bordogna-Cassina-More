Henle","title":"How CRISPR lets you edit DNA","details":"From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creatures on Earth, every living thing is defined by its genes. With recent advancements, scientists can change an organism's fundamental features in record time using gene editing tools such as CRISPR. But where did this medical marvel come from and how does it work? Andrea M. Henle examines the science behind this new technology.

Can we talk about that?","details":"Every doctor makes mistakes. But, says physician Brian Goldman, medicine's culture of denial (and shame) keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistakes, or using them to learn and improve. Telling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.","posted":"2012-01","url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/brian_goldman_doctors_make_mistakes_can_we_talk_about_that"},{"tags":["TED","talks","activism","big problems","economics","future","humanity","family","health","health care","government","parenting","society","social change","work","TEDx","women in business","women"],"_id":"714312324e6e962fb555a4f003f6de74","n_views":24811656,"durate_sec":1633,"main_speaker":"Jessica Shortall","title":"The US needs paid family leave �?�???? for the sake of its future","details":"We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.","posted":"2015-12","url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_shortall_the_us_needs_paid_family_leave_for_the_sake_of_its_future"},{"tags":["TED","talks","Africa","business","economics","global issues","innovation","invention","poverty","women","global development","philanthropy","inequality","markets"],"_id":"774fe833f83e873d402a41648442bedc","n_views":71090885,"durate_sec":1891,"main_speaker":"Jacqueline Novogratz","title":"A third way to think about aid","details":"The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust \"charity\" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets.

But across the world, girls and women are taught that their anger is better left unvoiced, says author Soraya Chemaly. Why is that, and what might we lose in this silence? In a provocative, thoughtful talk, Chemaly explores the dangerous lie that anger isn't feminine, showing how women's rage is justified, healthy and a potential catalyst for change.","posted":"2019-01","url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/soraya_chemaly_the_power_of_women_s_anger"}]
